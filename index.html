        <div class="line"></div>
        <p class="para"><i class="fa fa-book" style="font-size:48px;color:red"></i>The Famous Five is a series of children's adventure novels and short stories written by English author Enid Blyton. The first book, Five on a Treasure Island, was published in 1942. The novels feature the adventures of a group of young children – Julian, Dick, Anne and Georgina (George) – and their dog Timmy.Julian is intelligent as well as caring, responsible and kind. His cleverness and reliability are often noted by Aunt Fanny and George. He deals with the more "grown-up" things and looks out for his siblings and cousin in their adventures.George Kirrin (full name Georgina) is A tomboy. She owns Timmy, the loyal dog who is one of the Five. She detests being called by her full name or being seen as a girl, and has a fiery temper.Dick Kirrin is one of the Famous Five, the brother of Julian and Anne, and cousin of George. He has a cheeky sense of humour, but is also dependable and kind in nature. He is the same age as his cousin George, and the middle child of his siblings. Unlike her cousin George, Anne generally acts more girly and takes care of the domestic duties during the Five's various camping holidays. As the youngest, she is more likely than the others to be frightened, and does not enjoy the adventures as much as the others. Timmy is loving, loyal and intelligent. He is usually friendly, but will attack in order to protect the Famous Five if they are in danger. He understands George well and does whatever she tells him to.

    <h1>Enid Blyton</h1>
    
    <p id="Enid">Enid Blyton (11 August 1897 –  28 November 1968) (also known as Mary Pollock) was the most successful children’s writer of her generation. A prolific writer, she completed over 400 books during her lifetime. She is in the top 10 all-time bestseller lists – her books having sold over 600 million copies

Shy in her relations with the public, Enid Blyton revealed little of her private life. She was born in the late 1890s and was brought up in Buckingham. Her father hoped she might become a concert pianist, but despite her talent for music, she made the decision to be a children’s writer.

She took Froebel training and became a governess to a family of boys in Surrey and this experience encouraged her to set up a school for boys.

In her spare time, she began writing a variety of children’s stories. These ranged from natural botany books, biblical stories, a simplified version of Pilgrim’s Promise, to the Famous Five series and the ubiquitous Noddy and Big Ears stories.

In 1924, she married her first husband – H.A.Pollock with whom she had two daughters. She married her second husband Kenneth Waters in 1943.

Her first stories were published by George Newness and her fame grew through the popularity of her stories in the children’s magazine ‘Sunny Stories.’ Her books were controversial amongst literary critics and librarians. Her writings were often not seen as ‘great literature’ Some found the likes of Big Ears and Noddy just too childish (poor Noddy would frequently burst into tears at any sign of trouble in Toytown). For a considerable period, certain libraries would refuse to stock Enid Blyton’s books – despite strong demand from children themselves. In recent decades, the books have also been criticised for racist, sexist and xenophobic stereotypes.

The books tended to follow predictable plotlines which reflected Blyton’s perspective on morality and right behaviour. She said her books reflected her way of looking at the world.

“Most of you could write down perfectly correctly all the things that I believe in and stand for – you have found them in my books, and a writer’s books are always a faithful reflection of himself”

Yet, whilst the works of Enid Blyton might not have touched the heights of literature – and may compare unfavourably to the more ‘adult’ success of J.K.Rowling, her books were undoubtedly very popular amongst her core audience and did help a generation of children become interested in reading.</p>
